Overview
--------
This project involves the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten characters in the EMNIST dataset. The EMNIST dataset was gathered using the torchvision library. The CNN architecture includes 3 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. Batch Normalization and Dropout Regularization techniques were applied to both types of layers during the training of the model to improve its performance. The loss and accuracy were measured at each epoch during the training process to evaluate the performance of the model. Finally, the measurements were plotted to visualize the performance of the model. This README file provides an Overview and includes other information related to the project as outlined in the Table of Contents.
